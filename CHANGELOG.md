# Changelog

## Portalis 1.0.3 / backend 0.1.2 — 2026-08-05

### Changed

- Reorganized the Flutter frontend around explicit Collections and Media
  feature boundaries, with route-level screens and reusable presentation
  components colocated with their feature.
- Made Media independently reusable: file metadata, format capabilities, HEIC
  conversion, thumbnails, and the in-app viewer now live under
  `features/media`.
- Moved the remaining cross-feature visual primitives into `design/`; removed
  the transitional `ui/` implementation layer.

### Engineering

- Kept collection transfer, collaboration, and persistence state in the
  Collections feature while exposing `MediaPreview` as the extension point for
  future in-app image, text, audio, document, and richer video previews.
- Updated tests and imports to use feature-level public paths.

## Portalis 1.0.2 / backend 0.1.2 — 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- State files that cannot be read are now reported as errors instead of being
  mistaken for a first launch and overwritten.
- Settings accepts both normal and typographic dashes in the listen-port range.

### Changed

- Consolidated Flutter state into feature controllers, repositories, and pure
  domain models, with one application composition root.
- Confined Flutter-Rust Bridge DTOs to bootstrap and feature data adapters.
- Split Home and Settings into focused presentation components while keeping
  the same adaptive desktop and compact layouts.
- Renamed the backend sync scheduler around its actual responsibility:
  reconciliation.

### Engineering

- Added focused tests for listen-port parsing, settings copies, and vault read
  failures.
- Removed obsolete model, UI-barrel, and singleton-service compatibility code.

## Portalis 1.0.1 / backend 0.1.1 — 2026-08-05

### Added

- Added a persisted download-folder selector in Settings, supported on desktop
  and mobile.
- Added startup detection for a stale or mismatched native Rust backend.

### Fixed

- A Dart/Rust bridge mismatch now reports a clear compatibility error instead
  of failing later with a `RangeError` while decoding generated bindings.
- The startup compatibility message now gives the exact Windows release-build
  command needed when Flutter is loading an older native DLL.
- Download-folder changes are treated as restart-required and do not move
  torrents that were already registered.

### Engineering

- Added repository contribution instructions in `AGENT.md`.
- Corrected the Windows build helper to generate bindings from only the
  intended bridged modules.
