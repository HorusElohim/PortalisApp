# Portalis Nexus application core

This is Portalis's one native backend. Nexus owns the application lifecycle,
identity, local state, and application connections; its Torrent engine owns
media creation, verification, seeding, and piece transfer. There is no second
backend or compatibility binding between the two.

The root package builds `libbackend` for Flutter. The smaller workspace crates
keep wire protocol, portable networking, and server rules independent of UI
and storage adapters. The deployable server is another application of those
same rules, not a competing application core.

The architecture and migration contract live in [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md).

## Workspace

- `src`: Flutter boundary, application lifecycle, collections, persistence,
  and Torrent-engine adapter.
- `crates/protocol`: `limits`, `ids`, `frame`, `validate`.
- `crates/client`: canonical Manifest data, protocol rules, the current
  command actor, and the authenticated direct-or-relayed QUIC endpoint.
- `crates/server-core`: transport-independent server rules.
- `apps/server`: `config`, `state`, `shutdown`, `health`, `messages`, `quic`.
- `proto`: authoritative protobuf schemas.
- `demo`: runnable examples — see [`demo/README.md`](demo/README.md).
- `demo-m6`: standalone server and concurrent-client M6 walkthrough — see
  [`demo-m6/README.md`](demo-m6/README.md).

Deterministic rules live in their own modules and are covered by tests; the
QUIC plumbing they drive (`apps/server/src/quic.rs`, `crates/client/src/
transport/`) is excluded from the coverage gate as a platform adapter.

The QUIC endpoint uses Iroh 0.92 with default metrics disabled. That is the
newest Rust-1.85-compatible line before Iroh's pre-release Curve25519
transition, so it coexists with Portalis's final X25519 v3 share-key stack
without downgrading either cryptographic dependency. The endpoint surface is
small enough to move forward when the workspace raises its Rust baseline.

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --all-features
```

If Buf is installed:

```sh
buf lint
```

Nexus is pre-release, so a protocol change and every generated consumer change
together. A backward-compatibility gate begins only with the first externally
supported protocol version.

See it work end to end, server and clients in one process:

```sh
cargo run -p portalis-nexus-demo
```

Or run the M6 server and client story as two separate processes:

```sh
cargo run -p portalis-nexus-m6-demo --bin nexus-demo-server
# In another terminal:
cargo run -p portalis-nexus-m6-demo --bin nexus-demo-client
```

Run the server:

```sh
PORTALIS_NEXUS_DATA_DIR=./nexus-data \
PORTALIS_NEXUS_LISTEN_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8080 \
  cargo run -p portalis-nexus-server
```

The service logs its public QUIC `node_id`. Clients combine that ID with the
service address in an `EndpointAddr`; the ID authenticates the server, while
the address only says where to reach it.

Every Nexus executable installs a `tracing` subscriber. The production server
emits JSON; demos use compact text on stderr and keep their narrated steps on
stdout. Client and server transport logs carry connection IDs, message IDs,
and protocol variant names only — never encrypted payloads or private
metadata. Set `RUST_LOG` to tune them, for example:

```sh
RUST_LOG=portalis_nexus_client=debug,portalis_nexus_server=debug \
  cargo run -p portalis-nexus-demo
```

The server process requires durable storage and a stable QUIC identity. An
embedded deployment generates a private 32-byte `node-secret` file beside its
data on first start. For a MongoDB or container deployment, set
`PORTALIS_NEXUS_NODE_SECRET` to 64 hexadecimal characters generated once (for
example, `openssl rand -hex 32`) and retain it across restarts. The public node
ID is derived from that secret; never use the node ID as the secret.

Start a MongoDB server with:

```sh
PORTALIS_NEXUS_NODE_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
PORTALIS_NEXUS_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true \
  cargo run -p portalis-nexus-server
```

Registration writes a user and its first device in one transaction, so the
server needs a replica set rather than a standalone. `PORTALIS_NEXUS_DATABASE`
names the database and defaults to `portalis_nexus`. `docker/compose.yaml`
brings up both the server and a single-node replica set already configured for
this.

The MongoDB tests start their own replica set through Docker and are skipped
when Docker is unavailable. To run them against a server you already have:

```sh
PORTALIS_NEXUS_TEST_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true \
  cargo test -p portalis-nexus-server --test mongo
```

## Client

`NexusClient` is a supervised handle that owns no stream:

```rust
let endpoint = EndpointAddr::new(node_id).with_direct_addresses([address]);
let client = NexusClient::connect(endpoint).await?;
let pong = client.ping(42).await?;      // correlated, timed out, concurrent
let events = client.events();           // server-initiated envelopes
client.shutdown().await;                // finishes the stream and stops retrying
```

`connect` makes one handshake attempt, so a misconfigured endpoint fails
immediately. `connect_with_config` retries the first attempt too, and sets the
request timeout:

```rust
let config = ClientConfig {
    reconnect: ReconnectPolicy::new(initial, maximum, attempts)?,
    request_timeout: Duration::from_secs(5),
};
let client = NexusClient::connect_with_config(endpoint, &config).await?;
```

A supervisor task rebuilds the connection whenever it ends, so callers do not
reconnect by hand. `ReconnectPolicy` doubles its delay per failure, spreads it
across 80%-120% with randomized jitter, and caps the result at its maximum
delay. In-flight requests fail as soon as their connection drops rather than
waiting for the timeout.

Transport behaviour is covered by integration suites against real QUIC
connections:
`tests/connection.rs`, `tests/reconnect.rs`, and `tests/events.rs`, with shared
servers in `tests/common/`. Alongside the real service they drive a peer that
never answers, a peer with the wrong application protocol, and a dropped
connection.

## Backpressure and shutdown

Both peers split their QUIC stream into a read loop and one writer task joined
by a queue of at most `MAX_OUTBOUND_QUEUE` messages. Filling that queue
disconnects the peer, so a client that stops reading cannot grow server memory.
At most `MAX_PENDING_REQUESTS` commands may await a response at once.

On `SIGTERM` the server stops accepting QUIC connections and calls
`Shutdown::drain`, which asks every live stream to finish and waits up to
`GRACEFUL_DRAIN_TIMEOUT` for them to finish.
