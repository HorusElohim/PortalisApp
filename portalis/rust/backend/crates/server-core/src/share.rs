//! What publishing a snapshot does to a share.
//!
//! A share is the stable social object: a client-generated identifier, an
//! owner it never changes, and a revision that only ever moves forward. A
//! snapshot is immutable and content-addressed, so pointing at a different
//! `SnapshotId` is what "the share changed" means.
//!
//! These rules touch no storage and read no clock. Deciding what a
//! publication does, separately from performing it, is what lets the write
//! carry the revision it read and lose safely to a concurrent publisher.
//!
//! Nexus never sees inside a capsule. It compares capsule bytes to decide
//! whether a retry is identical, and otherwise treats them as opaque.
