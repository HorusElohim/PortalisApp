//! A person's devices, as a signed append-only log.
//!
//! A person is a device log, not an
//! account row. The distinction matters for one attack. If the service holds
//! the list, a hostile service can add a device to it, and an owner about to
//! seal a content key will seal to that device — the theft is silent and
//! nothing downstream can notice. A log makes it impossible rather than
//! merely auditable: every entry is signed by a device the log already
//! enrols, so extending it needs a key that is already inside.
//!
//! ```text
//! entry := "portalis.devicelog.v1\0"
//!          u8[32]  root_key                first device's Ed25519 key
//!          u64     sequence                1 at the root, then +1
//!          u8[32]  previous_hash           zero at the root
//!          u8      action                  1 = enrol, 2 = revoke
//!          u8[32]  subject_signing_key
//!          u8[32]  subject_encryption_key  zero for a revocation
//!          u64     at_unix_ns
//!          u8[32]  author_key              an enrolled, unrevoked device
//!          u8[64]  signature               over every preceding field
//! ```
//!
//! Replay is the whole interface: hand it entries and it returns the device
//! set they authorize, or the first reason they do not. Every rule is checked
//! at the point the entry claims to occupy, not against the final state —
//! a device revoked at sequence 5 cannot author at sequence 6, but the entries
//! it authored at sequence 3 stand.
