//! Deciding whether a revision belongs after the one already held.
//!
//! `protocol` can say whether a revision is well-formed and whether the key it
//! names signed it. Neither answers the question that matters, because both
//! dangerous attacks pass them. A revision signed by a device the owner
//! revoked last week is perfectly signed. An older revision, served in place
//! of the current one to undo a removal, is perfectly valid. A fork — two
//! revisions with the same number, both properly signed — is two perfectly
//! valid objects.
//!
//! What separates them is outside knowledge: the owner's device log, and the
//! highest revision this device already verified. That is why verification
//! lives in `client` and never in the service. The service stores and
//! forwards; a reader decides.
//!
//! Verification follows `SPEC.md` §7.3 in order — signature, then author
//! authority, then position in the chain, then the manifest it names — because
//! each step is more expensive than the last and a caller should not pay for
//! a store read to reject a forged signature.
//!
//! **Forks are never resolved silently.** A fork means a compromised owner
//! device or a service splitting members' views. The first revision seen at a
//! number is kept, the second is refused, and the caller is told, because
//! choosing between them is not a decision code can make correctly.
