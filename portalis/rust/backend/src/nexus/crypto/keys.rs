//! Sealing a collection's content key to the devices a verified log allows.
//!
//! This closes the device-log and revision loop. A
//! device log says which devices a person has; a revision says who a
//! collection's members are. Neither is worth anything until the moment a key
//! is actually sealed, because that is the moment a mistake becomes a stolen
//! secret rather than a wrong display.
//!
//! The one attack this module exists to prevent: a service adds a device to
//! someone's list, the owner seals the content key to it, and the service
//! reads everything. Nothing downstream can detect it — the ciphertext is
//! valid, the recipient is real, the owner did the sealing. So the defence has
//! to be structural, and it is: there is no parameter here through which a
//! device outside a replayed log can enter. A recipient's encryption key and
//! device id both come from the log itself.
//!
//! A **stale** log is the same attack wearing different clothes. Yesterday's
//! log is genuine, signed, and still contains the device revoked this morning.
//! [`Recipient`] therefore cannot be built from a log directly — only by
//! adopting an offered one over a log already held, which is where
//! [`DeviceLog::adopt`] refuses anything behind or forked from what is known.
//! Getting this wrong is not possible rather than merely discouraged.
//!
//! Removing a member means rotating: a new key, sealed only to those who
//! remain. What a former member already holds cannot be recalled, so the point
//! is that the *next* revision is closed to them.
